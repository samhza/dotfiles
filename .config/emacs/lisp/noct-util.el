  "Tangle org init FILE if it has not already been tangled.
If LOAD is non-nil, load it as well. If RETANGLE is non-nil,
tangle FILE even if it is not newer than the current tangled
file. If COMPILE is non-nil, and the uncompiled file is newer,
compile it. If DEMOTE-ERRORS is non-nil, wrap each source block
with `with-demoted-errors'.

If both LOAD and COMPILE are specified, load the compiled version
of FILE if it is newer than the tangled version. Otherwise load
the tangled version (since this is much faster than compiling and
then loading).

Only compile if COMPILE is non-nil and LOAD is nil. In this case,
load the tangled init FILE first. Compiling after loading ensures
that all required functionality is available (have to add
everything under ~/.emacs.d/straight/build to `load-path' in an
`eval-when-compile', run `straight-use-package-mode' so :straight
is recognized, etc., etc.; it's easier to just compile afterwards).

When there are no errors loading the tangled file, save it with a

loaded)."
